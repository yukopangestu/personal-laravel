# Fix for Blank Page in Docker

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Frontend Assets Not Being Built**
   - The Dockerfile has been updated to build frontend assets during the image build process
   - This ensures that the assets are available even when just running `docker-up` without running the `dev` target

2. **Redis Host Configuration**
   - The Redis host in the .env file was set to 127.0.0.1, which doesn't work in Docker
   - Updated to use 'redis' as the host, which is the service name in docker-compose.yml

3. **Database Configuration**
   - The application was configured to use SQLite, but the Docker setup includes a MySQL database
   - Updated the .env file to use MySQL with the correct host, database name, username, and password

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Rebuild the Docker image and restart the containers:
   ```bash
   make docker-rebuild
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
   ```

3. Clear Laravel cache:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize:clear
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:4001

## If the Issue Persists

If the page is still blank after applying these fixes, check the logs for any errors:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Or specifically the app container logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
```

You can also check the Laravel logs:

```bash
docker-compose exec app cat storage/logs/laravel.log
```
